## Sort and Visualize Algorithms

This JavaScript project provides an interactive platform for visualizing and experimenting with various sorting algorithms. It offers an interface where users can observe the step-by-step process of sorting an array of values represented by bars.

### Features

- **Algorithm Selection:** Users can choose among popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- **Real-time Visualization:** The sorting process is graphically demonstrated through animated bar movements, allowing users to witness the sorting algorithms in action.
- **Customizable Settings:** Users can control parameters like sorting speed, the range of numbers in the array, and the number of bars for tailored visualizations.
- **Interactive Controls:** Options to randomize the array, alter sorting speed, and trigger sorting algorithms are available through dedicated buttons.

### Functionality

The code contains functions for generating random arrays, rendering bars to represent array values, various sorting algorithms, and elements for animating the sorting process.

### Usage

1. **Randomization:** Click the "Randomize Array" button to generate a new random array. This array will be displayed as bars on the interface for visualization.
2. **Sorting:** Select an algorithm from the dropdown list and click the "Sort" button to initiate the sorting process. The bars will visually rearrange according to the selected algorithm, providing a clear representation of the sorting steps.

### Algorithms Supported

1. **Bubble Sort:** Illustrates the classic bubble sort algorithm.
2. **Merge Sort:** Offers a visualization of the merge sort algorithm.
3. **Heap Sort:** Demonstrates the heap sort algorithm.
4. **Insertion Sort:** Displays the insertion sort algorithm.
5. **Quick Sort:** Provides a visual representation of the quick sort algorithm for sorting.

The project aims to deliver an interactive learning experience, helping users understand and observe the inner workings of various sorting algorithms.

*Note: The visualization of the Merge Sort algorithm might not be fully representative due to technical constraints.*

Feel free to experiment with different algorithms and settings to observe their behavior and efficiency in sorting arrays.

This JavaScript project is a valuable tool for educational purposes, offering a visual aid for understanding the functioning of different sorting algorithms.
